==================

Color tables, placefiles, and other items for the Gibson Ridge family of weather visualization products. Pull requests welcomed and encouraged!

If you are new to Gibson Ridge products (especially the use of placefiles and shapefiles), see the Gibson Ridge documentation here: http://www.grlevelx.com/manuals/gis/menu_gis.htm

AWIPS Cities
------------

The AWIPS Cities placefile is a preliminary stab at converting data found at 

http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/national/html/cities.htm

to Gibson Ridge placefile format, with a minimal-effort pass (so far) at mapping AWIPS progressive disclosure values to different viewing thresholds in GR. More work is needed here!

Marine Zones Style File (style-files/Marine Zones.sty)
------------------------------------------------------

Use this style file combined with the shapefiles found here:

http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/wsom/html/marinezones.htm

to display various marine zones under NWS forecast responsibility (tested and works with all coastal and Great Lakes marine zones).

Counties Style File (style-files/Counties.sty)
----------------------------------------------

Use this style file combined with the shapefile found here:

http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/county/html/county.htm

to display counties as loaded into AWIPS.
